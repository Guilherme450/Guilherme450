# Hello there! My name is Guilherme Lima.
## Welcome to my account

### I always had a huge passion for science and technology. Moreover, for me not only the cooperation and mutual development are crucial but also the continuos study and dedication make an import role in the life of anyone. Furthermore, because of this I'm in search of master data science and understand its powerful applications from business to machine learning and then implement it in real world. Of course that it won't be easy to master quickly, but with the community help and a hard work I'll do it and insert myself in this ascending field.
